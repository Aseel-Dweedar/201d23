            <p class="mainP">Hey, this is me Aseel Dweedar, I will try to talk about myself briefly in order to make you know me well, I graduated from the Faculty of Architecture in 2015, and I tried many jobs within five years, these experiences changed me a lot, so
                I became more powerful and I like new challenges. now I am learning software development, it is an interesting and wonderful field, and I hope to become a professional software developer.
                <br><br> As for myself, I am a very calm person, not very social nor introverted, I love everyone and I love to help others. I like going out with my family a lot, I like buying clothes and watching movies. You can always know more about
                me by following me on social media. So keep in touch ..</p>
